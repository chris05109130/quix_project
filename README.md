Quiz Project

Description:

This project I decided to just make a basic quiz. It asked basic questions that deal with html and css. All you have to do is read the question, make what you think is 
the correct answer, hit submit and onto the next. When you are all done answering the questions you will be then be taken to the summary report page. On that page it will say
how many you got correct and how many you got wrong. Followed by the question under the correct or wrong on that page just to show you which ones you got right and which ones you need to work on. 

For this quiz it helped me get a better understanding of javascript with dealing with the logic behind it. Maybe in the future I could also expand on this project by adding a quiz to a website I might have, so in a way its very helpful to create and make and helps you get a better understanding.
